# loki

An inspired-by-Grab dynamic mock server for HTTP testing.

Loki is easy to test your APIs by setting your mock
expectations by using RESTful APIs over HTTP. Send
requests to set your expectations and Loki is ready for
testing your APIs.

## Warning
It is **an unofficial project** that was inspired by
*Grab Tech Blog: Loki, a Dynamic Mock Server for
HTTP/TCP Testing*.
